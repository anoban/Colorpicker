# ___A mininal but complete `Win32` colorpicker desktop application___
---------------

### - A shameless clone of the `Electron` based Colorpicker by @Toinane [Link](https://github.com/Toinane/colorpicker).
### - All design credits goes to him. This is just a `Win32` C++ port of his application.
### - Done primarily for learning Win32 GUI development as a hobby.
